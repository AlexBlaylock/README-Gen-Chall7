## description
This is challenge 9 for my bootcamp. This is a ReadMe generator that uses inquirer to ask questions and then generates a markdown file based on answers.

## installation
There is no deployed application as of yet.

## license
This project is licensed by [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## use
You use a terminal to answer questions prompted by inquirer, and then a markdown file is generated. This is great for a quick and easy way to generate ReadMe files.

## testing
I used VSCode integrated terminal

## contribution
Add more indepth styling to the markdown, make a deployed application, fix link for licensing in ToC.

## questions
For questions, you can reach me at my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/AlexBlaylock) or via email at alexb9901@hotmail.com.
